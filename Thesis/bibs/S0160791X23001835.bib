abstract = {This study investigates how virtual reality (VR) can enhance telepresence and stimulate VR use and travel intentions in the sustainable tourism industry. 512 local and international tourists in Vietnam participated in an online survey after experiencing a VR experiment. They interacted with an app presenting a sustainable tourist destination based on nature, with the treatment group using VR sets and the control group viewing it on a 2D screen. Results indicate that VR-based tours facilitate greater telepresence than 2D presentations. VR is not a substitute for actual travel, with higher intentions reported to use VR in the future and to visit the tourist destination in real life due to their greater telepresence and perceived enjoyment from VR. This has implications for nature-based sustainable tourism, with further research needed for other types of tourism, including extreme activities.}
