Motion Sickness is a common problem in Virtual Reality (VR).
It is often described as discontinuity between seen motion and motion felt by the vestibular system, though multiple other factors play a role.
While much research has been done to understand why motion sickness occurs and when it is happening in the user, little has been done to actively prevent motion sickness as or before it occurs.
We use a machine learning algorithm to detect when a user is likely experiencing motion sickness.
Once motion sickness has been detected, corresponding mitigation features such as vignetting, snap turning, or user warnings are enabled on the user's behalf.
We found that this method of active motion sickness mitigation is feasible.
We also found that consideration must be taken into the performance impact that this active mitigation system may have on the VR system.
