abstract = {Virtual Reality systems have the potential to change the way we interact with digital content in vehicles. However, wearing a VR headset in a vehicle may increase the chances of experiencing motion sickness. There is an open question as to how to convey visual motion alongside VR content to reduce motion sickness. This research explores possible countermeasures to alleviate motion sickness by delivering visual cues of physical motion through the position of virtual displays, implicitly conveying the motion without the need for additional distracting visual cues, which could alleviate motion sickness. The results showed that such visual cues significantly reduced symptoms associated with motion sickness. We expected our findings to lead to concrete suggestions to optimize VR user experiences and user comfort in vehicles.},

abstract = {Despite the increasing popularity of VR games, one factor hindering the industry’s rapid growth is motion sickness experienced by the users. Symptoms such as fatigue and nausea severely hamper the user experience. Machine Learning methods could be used to automatically detect motion sickness in VR experiences, but generating the extensive labeled dataset needed is a challenging task. It needs either very time consuming manual labeling by human experts or modification of proprietary VR application source codes for label capturing. To overcome these challenges, we developed a novel data collection tool, VRhook, which can collect data from any VR game without needing access to its source code. This is achieved by dynamic hooking, where we can inject custom code into a game’s run-time memory to record each video frame and its associated transformation matrices. Using this, we can automatically extract various useful labels such as rotation, speed, and acceleration. In addition, VRhook can blend a customized screen overlay on top of game contents to collect self-reported comfort scores. In this paper, we describe the technical development of VRhook, demonstrate its utility with an example, and describe directions for future research.},

abstract = {This study investigates how virtual reality (VR) can enhance telepresence and stimulate VR use and travel intentions in the sustainable tourism industry. 512 local and international tourists in Vietnam participated in an online survey after experiencing a VR experiment. They interacted with an app presenting a sustainable tourist destination based on nature, with the treatment group using VR sets and the control group viewing it on a 2D screen. Results indicate that VR-based tours facilitate greater telepresence than 2D presentations. VR is not a substitute for actual travel, with higher intentions reported to use VR in the future and to visit the tourist destination in real life due to their greater telepresence and perceived enjoyment from VR. This has implications for nature-based sustainable tourism, with further research needed for other types of tourism, including extreme activities.}

abstract="Background: Recently, technology that provides virtual reality (VR) content based on streaming services has been rapidly developed. However, there have been few studies to reduce VR sickness that occurs while the user watches VR content while wearing a head-mounted display (HMD) in real time. Objective: Based on this background, we propose a new approach to measure and reduce VR sickness that occurs while the user watches VR content while wearing an HMD in real time. Methods: The proposed approach is to apply VR sickness reduction methods in accordance with the user's real-time VR sickness level. Three methods that are known to be effective in reducing VR sickness and a single type of VR content were used to examine the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which was confirmed by the experimental results. Results: Our results show that VR sickness significantly decreased when a new approach was applied to VR content (in all cases, P<.05). Conclusions: From our results, it was confirmed that VR sickness could be measured without wearing additional equipment, and its reduction method could be applied in real time in accordance with the user's condition by the proposed approach in this paper.
